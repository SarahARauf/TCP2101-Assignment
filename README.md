üõ†Ô∏è Mini Data Structure Language Interpreter
--

This project is a custom interpreter designed to process and execute commands for basic data structures such as Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees (BST), Single Linked Lists (SLL), and Double Linked Lists (DLL). It allows users to define, manipulate, and traverse these data structures using a mini programming language. The interpreter supports pointer-based navigation for linked lists and demonstrates key object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory management in C++.

Key Features:

- Handles multiple data structures (Stack, Queue, BST, SLL, DLL).

- Supports operations like adding, deleting, and inserting elements.

- Pointer navigation for linked lists.

- Written in C++ with a focus on dynamic memory management and object-oriented design.
